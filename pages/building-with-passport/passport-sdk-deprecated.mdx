# Passport SDK (deprecated)

> **Please note! Gitcoin recommends using the** [**Scorer API**](../scorer-api/) **going forward. We have stopped supporting the SDK and begun the process of deprecating it.**

The Gitcoin Passport SDK is comprised of a set of libraries distributed on npm to help developers interact with Passport data living on [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network/).

For more information on [Gitcoin Passport](https://app.gitbook.com/o/Aqbtj6s4OkLaygileCka/s/ttgfRNVjO2DcVvUNyst9/) or to interact with a live instance, please visit [passport.gitcoin.co](https://passport.gitcoin.co/).
