## Where to start

To take your very first steps into building apps with Gitcoin Passport, you can visit the [Quick Start guide](../quick-start-guide.md).&#x20;

If you want to go deeper into gating access using Passport scores and learn about best practices for Passport scoring, visit [Gating access with Passport scores](gating-access-with-passport-scores.md).

To learn how to work with individual stamps and use stamp and scorer data in your app's UI, read the [Integrating stamps and scorers](integrating-stamps-and-scorers.md) guide.



## Tutorials

### Gating access with Passport scores

This tutorial will guide you through building a simple "knowledge hub" app with some specific content that can only be accessed by users with a Passport score above a threshold.&#x20;

The app is built using [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/), [Chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/), and [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/).
