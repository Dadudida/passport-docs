# Presenting your Gitcoin Passport

Connecting your Passport to an app couldn't be easier. If an application uses Gitcoin Passport it will display a "**Connect**" or "**Sign in with Ethereum**" button.&#x20;

Clicking the button will open a prompt to connect using your Ethereum wallet. Choose your wallet, check and sign the message that appears, and the app takes care of everything else.&#x20;

Behind the scenes, the app will send a request to the Gitcoin Passport API to retrieve your Passport score. As a user, you will simply see the content available to you based on your passport score.

{% hint style="success" %}
Be sure to sign in using the same Ethereum address that you used to create your Passport!
{% endhint %}

If you can't access content because your Passport score is too low, go back to the [Passport app](https://passport.gitcoin.co) and **verify more stamps**!

See the concept in action in this introductory video:
