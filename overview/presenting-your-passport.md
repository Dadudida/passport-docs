# Who is Gitcoin Passport for?

### Internet Citizens 🙋🏽

[Gitcoin Passport](../building-with-passport/major-concepts.md#passports) is for people who want to prove their humanity and online reputation, without compromising their privacy.

Passport makes it easy for you to collect different pieces of your identity on the internet—from social media sites like Twitter and Facebook to online verification tools like BrightID and Proof of Humanity—into a single place that showcases that you are a trustworthy person who deserves access to digital experiences.

The more pieces of evidence of your identity and reputation, aka "[stamps](../building-with-passport/major-concepts.md#stamps)", that you collect, the easier it is for project and community leaders to trust that you are who you say you are. Your stamps are aggregated into a Passport score which can be used by apps to control access to their content. You can always improve your score by collecting more stamps.

### Project Owners & Developers 🧑‍💻

Whether you are running a DAO, planning an airdrop, building a social media platform, publishing games or managing an online community, you probably want one user identity to represent one real person. People might try to unfairly influence your project by creating many accounts and pretending to be more than one real-life human. Gitcoin Passport is a solution to this problem.&#x20;

Integrating Passport protects your community with a "gate" that raises the cost of creating fake accounts to repel bad actors.

"Passport-gating" your project gives your users an opportunity to verify their humanity and reputation—including their group membership, cultural background, and expertise. Users have full control over what they share at every step of the way and do not need to expose their personal data.

Integrating Passport also empowers you to experiment with new mechanisms for governance and accreditation, by enabling you to create new [stamps](../building-with-passport/major-concepts.md#stamps) that you award your users and members for completing certain actions.

Gitcoin provides battle-tested defaults for verifying accounts. However,  Passport will soon allow you to create your own scoring algorithm that gives custom weights to different stamps (aka pieces of evidence for a real identity). For example, a developer DAO can weigh a Github verification more highly than a social DAO, which may instead care more if their members have a lot of social media followers.

### Identity Providers 🪪

Passport is on its way to becoming the go-to solution for projects to protect their communities, and the identity aggregator internet citizens trust most to access the best and most trustworthy experiences in web3. If participation in your platform can be expressed in the form of a verifiable credential then it can be represented as a Gitcoin Passport stamp, meaning you can start experimenting with composable communities and network effects across web3, while your users benefit from more proof of personhood.
