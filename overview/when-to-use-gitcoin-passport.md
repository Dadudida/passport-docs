# When to use Gitcoin Passport

Here are some examples of why having your own Passport — with many stamps — may come in handy:

* An **event organizer** could use Passport to gate access to their event, only allowing people with certain stamps in their Passport.
* A **grants program manager** could integrate Passport into their QF (quadratic funding) program (such as Gitcoin Grants) and only offer matching funds to donors with a Passport over a certain score
* A **community organizer** could gate a sub-community with Passport, only allowing access to members that have earned a certain set of stamps through meaningful participation in the community.
* The **developers** **of an online marketplace** could use Passport to gate their marketplace and only allow access to more trusted users, aiming to reduce fraud on the platform.
* An **airdrop experience** could target require Gitcoin Passport users with certain stamps or a score above a threshold to thwart airdrop farmers.
* If the **developer of an online polling service** uses Passport to gate polls, this might mean that you can trust the results more, since they might be less tampered with bot manipulation.

When you arrive at a Passport-gated app, you'll be prompted to connect your wallet. The app will use your address to fetch information about your Passport, including what stamps it has.
